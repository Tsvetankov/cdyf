# Your interviews & offers {#interviewing}

Congratulations, you've been invited to an interview. It might be a telephone, video or face-to-face, or it might even be as part of an assessment centre where you'll be asked to complete several other tasks and tests. Being invited to an interview means that your CV, along with any accompanying covering letters, application forms or digital portfolios, have hit the target. BULLSEYE! ðŸŽ¯

```{r bugfree-fig, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:captionbugfree)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/My CV is bug free.png")
```
(ref:captionbugfree) If you have got an interview, then you have proved that your CV is bug free. That doesn't mean your CV is perfect, it just means that it is good enough to get you an interview with that particular employer. Congratulations! What comes next?

If you've got an interview, you can feel good about having a bug-free CV shown in Figure \@ref(fig:bugfree-fig). But now you have a new set of problems. How can you prepare for the interview? What kinds of interviews exist and what questions might you be asked? If they offer you a job, how will you negotiate the terms, conditions and salary? Do you *really* want the job anyway and are they the kind of people you actually want to work with everyday? You'll be giving this employer:

* most of the hours of your day
* most of the days of your week
* most of the weeks of your year
* most of the years of your life (if you stay that long)

So you want to ensure employers are a good match and not going to waste your time.

## What you will learn {#ilo9}

* Identify kinds of interviews you might be invited to
* Prepare for common interview questions, technical and non-technical

## Interviews

Broadly speaking there are two basic kinds of interviews

* technical (or coding interview)
* non-technical (sometimes called competency based interview)

## Competency interviews

For non-technical interview see

* [google.com/search?q=competency+based+interview+questions](https://www.google.com/search?q=competency+based+interview+questions)
* [careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/interviews](https://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/interviews/)

The rest of this chapter will focus on technical interviews, aka coding interviews.

## Coding interviews

<!-- I Cheated on My Microsoft Interview you can cheat [@cheating]


1. Using a whiteboard (or even google docs), you're unlikely to have access to a compiler or an IDE
1. Pattern matching (what interview questions are similar to this)
1. Simplify and generalise (tweak constraints, then does that approach )
1. Clarify the question, state your assumptions
1. Base case and build () start from n = 1, then build to n = 2 etc [@polya]
1. Show your working, talk out loud, mention trade-offs of your approach^[gayle video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0B4mOtwX0]


Solving different coding challenges can help you become a better problem solver, master a given programming language, prepare for job interviews and learn new algorithms. It will help you become a better engineer and can provide good evidence for the experience section of your CV.-->


There are a lots of resources to help you prepare for and practice coding interview questions, the best place to start is *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmaan McDowell. [@cracking] As well as reading Gayle's book, there are lots of online resources to help you prepare for coding interviews.


### Project Euler {#euler}
Project Euler provides a wide range of challenges in computer science and mathematics. The challenges typically involve solving a mathematical formula or equation, see [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/)


### Hacker Rank {#hackerrank}
Hacker rank allows developers to practice their coding skills, prepare for interviews and get hired. HackerRank allows users to submit applications and apply to jobs by solving company-sponsored coding challenges.

Hacker Rank provide a discussion and leaderboard for every challenge, and most challenges come with an editorial that explains more about the challenge, see [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

### Topcoder
TopCoder is a platform for competitive programming online. You can complete on your own directly online using their code editor. Single Round Matches are offered a few times per month at a specific time where you compete against others to solve challenges against the clock, see [topcoder.com](https://www.topcoder.com/)


### Codewars
Codewars allows you to challenge yourself on [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata), created by the community to strengthen different skills. Master your current language of choice, or expand your understanding of a new one. Find out more at [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com)


### Leetcode
LeetCode is a platform to help you enhance your skills, expand your knowledge and prepare for technical interview see [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com).

### Pramp

Pramp offers free mock technical interviewing platform for engineers. Pramp, **Pra**ctice **m**akes **p**erfect, was founded in 2015 by Rafi Zikavashvili and David Glauber. As engineers, they were frustrated by the lack of resources to help them prepare for coding interviews. Find out more at [pramp.com](https://www.pramp.com)

### UKIEPC
The United Kingdom and Ireland Programming Competition (UKIEPC) is a subregional contest for the Northwestern Europe European Regional Contest (NWERC), that it turn is part of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) series organised by the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery) (ACM). UKIEPC has been held annually since 2013 to help universities pick teams to travel to NWERC. Ask your University if they are involved, see [ukiepc.info/](http://ukiepc.info/)

<!-- interviews can be counter-productively stressful

<!--### changing your mind

You may decide to change your mind about an offer you've already accepted. You need to

* Are you sure? Think it through carefully, discuss your options with friends and family.
* Read your contract of employment again: there may be clauses in your contract describing the consequences of changing your mind - make sure you understand these
* Tell the employer quickly: explain why you've changed your mind (personal circumstances, you have a better offer etc) the sooner the better
* Learn from this mistake: it's not good to accept offers you're not serious about so try to learn from this mistake so you don't repeat it in the future
